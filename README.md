# Handcorder
A bridge hand and session recorder for informal games for 1 to 6 tables. Built with a simple stack like javascript (Vue/React), css, and html. The games will be stored in the traditional format so a varity of exixting bridge utility programs can use it. Should be versions for desktop and mobile devices.

There is not a lot of programs available for recording informal games. Most are setup to record official games of the American Contract Bridve League. There is a lot romm to add additional interesting functionality like printing out hands, automatic scoring,result sheet, and hand analasys( called double dummy). Simple instructios for deciding who plays who where. (called movemnts. Maybe a robot director to decide what to do when mistakes are made.

Cloud storage in a sharable folder would be good.
